***Decentralized Autonomous Organizations*** *(DAO)* is the keyword of the future. I believe tomorrows platforms will be managed by communities, wherein users and their collectives will earn a living.

I am working on a technology, which **rewards user contributions**.

MyVision is a Toolsest which allows users to deploy and host their own platform as an organization which works as an ecosystem itself and can be linked to others.

My keywords I am working with are

- Fintech
- Blockchain
- SmartContracts
- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
- Decentralized Governance
- Progressive Web Applications
- Social Media Platforms
- Economics
